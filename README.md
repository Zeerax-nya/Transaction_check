This code helps me do my routine work of checking transactions. 
Every day I need to checking transactions through excel files from two sources: provider data and PC data.
So it takes me about 30 minutes to create all files and compare them.

The purpose of code is to check transaction parameters in different csv files. And give me all problems in xlsx file.
